Hello Sir! I am unable to change the actual name of the repository...

But just to avoid confusion i'm letting you know that this is the oodoo18 version now for midterms and finals!

also to add, if you check the second and third"attempts" in daigler, it will bring you to a new repository but with the correct name 

to reflect that its oodoo18 hotel addons for the midterms and finals, the postgresql functions was added later into the file

so if you don't see it check the third third attempt, its there
